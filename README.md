# Machine Learning using Google Collab:


This is a Google collab linked code where we can find basics of machine learning using sklearn as well as tensorflow

Using Python3 for Learning Maching Learning Algorithms

For each kind of Machine Learning Algorithm in this repository we can find 
1. Working on 2 different datasets for each Model
2. Tensor flow implementation for the same Model

Eg: Linear Regression will have its model implemented in Scikit Learn on 2 different Datasets,
It will also have Tensor flow implementation for the same.

# Basic Understandings:

1. Need no prior installations are needed
2. Everything can be done at run time in the Google Collaborations
3. At run time we can install external packages using 
	!pip install <pkg>
	Eg: !pip install sklearn
	
4. We can even collaborate your code with Github directly from the console by linking your git account.
	see git installation for furthur knowledge
	https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git
5. You can also involve multiple people to collaborate with the code
6. Deep Learning techniques which require heavy GPU can be used for free here.

# THANKS G O O G L E FOR SUCH A NICE GESTURE
	
	Hope this continuos free forever.
	
	
	
This repository mainly concentrates by adding multiple Algorithms and EDA for each algorithms.
This repository can act as a reference book for future Machine Learning Engineers.

Correct me if found anything wrong.
